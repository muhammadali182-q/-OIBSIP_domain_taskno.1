‚û¢ pip install requests
‚û¢ Also, get your free API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
```
**How to Run**

1. Replace the API key in the script:
2. API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
3. Run the app:
4. python weather_app.py

**How the API Works**

The app sends a request to:

[http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric](http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric)

It then extracts the required fields (temp, humidity, condition) and shows them in the GUI.
